## Why System Design?

System design is a complex and critical topic in software engineering. It requires understanding a broad range of concepts and being able to apply them effectively. Mastering system design involves going through diverse resources across different platforms, which can be overwhelming. This repository aims to simplify that journey by consolidating valuable resources in one place.

## Repository Goals

- **Centralized Knowledge**: Gather top-notch system design resources in one repository.
- **Diverse Learning Materials**: Include articles, books, videos, and practical examples.
- **Interview Preparation**: Provide a solid foundation and advanced concepts to excel in system design interviews.
- **Community Contribution**: Encourage sharing and contribution from the community to keep the repository updated and comprehensive.

## What's Inside

- **Foundational Concepts**: Basics of system design, core principles, and key terminologies.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Detailed explanations of various architectural patterns and their use cases.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Techniques and strategies for building scalable and high-performance systems.
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the application of system design principles.
- **Interview Guides**: Tips, strategies, and common questions for system design interviews.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Overview of essential tools and technologies used in system design.
